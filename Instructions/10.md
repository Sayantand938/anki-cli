### ‚úÖ **JSON Transcription Format Instructions**

Transcribe each quiz question into a **JSON file** that follows this **strict structure and formatting rules**.

---

#### üî¢ **Required Fields per Question Object**

Each question **must be** a JSON object containing these keys (in this order):

1. `"Question"` ‚Äì The full question text
2. `"OP1"` ‚Äì Option 1
3. `"OP2"` ‚Äì Option 2
4. `"OP3"` ‚Äì Option 3
5. `"OP4"` ‚Äì Option 4
6. `"Answer"` ‚Äì Correct Option number (e.g., Answer=3 means OP3 is correct)


---

#### üß† **Formatting & Content Rules**

* Use `\(...\)` to wrap **all LaTeX math expressions** (e.g., `\(\frac{a}{b}\)`, `\(\tan \theta\)`).
* Use `<br>` for **line breaks** inside the `"Question"` field (especially when multi-sentence or paragraph-style).
* If there is any image in the Question or Option then use `<image content>` as placeholder alt text instead of the image, later I will manually copy paste that image.
* If any **table** is present, convert it into valid **HTML table format** using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.
* For **underline**, use `<u>...</u>`.
* The output must be a **valid JSON array**, enclosed in `[...]`.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Other Rules**

* Every entry must be **self-contained** and valid JSON.
* Keep consistent indentation and quote style (use double quotes `"` for keys and strings).
* Correct answer must match one of the four options **exactly and fully**.
